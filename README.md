# Malware Analysis Lab/ Work in progress

## Objective

My goal for this lab is to refine my expertise in malware analysis, deepening my knowledge and understanding of this critical cybersecurity domain while honing essential skills for identifying, dissecting, and mitigating malicious software threats.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
